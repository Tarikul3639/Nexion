# GitHub Authentication Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented GitHub OAuth authentication for the Nexion application. Here's a summary of what has been completed:

## Frontend (Next.js)

1. **GitHub Auth Hook (`useGithubAuth.ts`):**
   - Created a hook to handle GitHub OAuth flow
   - Implemented functions to redirect to GitHub for authorization
   - Added code to handle OAuth callback from GitHub
   - Set up user data extraction and authentication with backend

2. **GitHub Callback Page:**
   - Created a page at `/auth/github/callback` to handle GitHub OAuth redirects
   - Shows a loading indicator while authentication is processed

3. **API Routes:**
   - Added `/api/auth/github/callback` to exchange OAuth code for access token
   - Added `/api/auth/github-login` to authenticate with the backend

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Created `.env.example` to document required environment variables
   - Added GitHub OAuth client ID and secret configuration

## Backend (Express)

1. **GitHub Login Controller:**
   - Created controller to handle GitHub authentication
   - Implemented user lookup by GitHub provider ID
   - Added user creation if not found
   - Set up user session management
   - Configured JWT token generation

2. **Routes:**
   - Added `/api/auth/github-login` route for GitHub authentication

3. **User Model Integration:**
   - Updated authentication to work with the existing User model
   - Added GitHub provider to the OAuth providers list

## Documentation

1. **Setup Guide:**
   - Created `GITHUB_OAUTH_SETUP.md` with instructions for setting up GitHub OAuth
   - Included steps to register a GitHub OAuth application
   - Added environment variable configuration instructions

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, you need to:

1. **Register a GitHub OAuth App:**
   - Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > OAuth Apps
   - Create a new OAuth app with callback URL: `http://your-domain/auth/github/callback`
   - Get the Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create `.env.local` in the web directory with:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
     GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
     ```

3. **Test the Implementation:**
   - Start both frontend and backend servers
   - Try logging in with GitHub on the login page
   - Verify the user is created/authenticated correctly

The GitHub authentication is now fully implemented and ready to use!
